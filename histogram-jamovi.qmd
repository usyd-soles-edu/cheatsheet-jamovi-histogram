## About {-}

The histogram is a bar plot that shows the frequency of (often) continuous values in a dataset. It helps identify patterns, outliers, and the shape of the distribution (skewness, kurtosis).

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Assumed knowledge
- You have [Jamovi installed](), ideally 2.5.7.0 or later.
- You can follow instructions to select, click and drag elements in Jamovi.

## Data structure
The data should be in a **long format** (also known as tidy data), where each row is an observation and each column is a variable (@fig-format). If your data is not already structured this way, reshape it manually in a spreadsheet program or in R using the `pivot_longer()` function from the `tidyr` package.


::: {layout="[ 0.4, -0.1, 0.4 ]" #fig-format}

:::: {#first-column}
```{r}
#| echo: false
possums <- readxl::read_excel("possum_bw.xlsx")
possums |>
  head(8) |>
  gt() |>
  opt_stylize(style = 5, color = "red")
```
:::

::: {#second-column}
```{r}
#| echo: false
possums |>
  group_by(Sex) |>
  mutate(row = row_number()) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = Sex, values_from = BW) |>
  select(-row) |>
  head(4) |>
  gt() |>
  opt_stylize(style = 5, color = "red")
```
:::

Data should be in long format (left) where each row is an observation and each column is a variable. This is the preferred format for most statistical software. Wide format (right) is also common, but may require additional steps to analyse or visualise in some instances.

## Data
::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Download data
We have two separate datasets. The first dataset is part of the possums dataset used in [BIOL2022](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/BIOL2022) labs. It contains two numerical variables: `ExpBLUP` and `AactiveTBLUP`. The data is available in the file `possums-blup.csv`.

The second dataset, `penguins.csv`, contains data collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER. Details about the dataset can be found [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

## Plot


1. Click on the **Analyses** tab.
2. Select **Exploration** > **Descriptives**.
3. Drag the variables you want to plot into the **Variables** box. It should be a numerical variable, e.g. `bill_length_mm` from the `penguins` dataset.
4. Select **Histogram** from the **Plots** dropdown menu.

## Extra options

1. If you want to colour the points by a categorical variable, drag the categorical variable into the **Split by** box. For example, you can split the histogram by the `species` variable in the `penguins` dataset.
2. Layer an additional density plot by selecting **Density** from the **Plots** dropdown menu.
3. Rename variables by clicking on the variable name in the **Variables** tab.



## Export

To export the plot, right click on the plot, select Image > Export... > Browse and rename the file before clicking on the Save button.
